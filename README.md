# ML1-regression-ridge-lasso-elastic

Project prepared for a subject [Machine Learning 1](https://usosweb.wne.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=2400-DS1ML1) at my graduate studies.

This is my first machine learning project, so in retrospect and experience gained, I see some things to improve in it.
In a separate folder you can also find a classification model realized within the same subject.

The main goal of the project was:

- learning about machine learning algorithms, 
- applying appropriate quality measures of supervised learning algorithms,
- model testing and model selection (a compromise between model variance and its bias, cross validation, selection of the number of steps),
- learning the methods of selecting variables (stepwise selection, backward elimination, forward selection),
- learning the methods of regularization.
